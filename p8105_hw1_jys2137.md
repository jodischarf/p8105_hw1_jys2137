The purpose of this file is to present the answers to Homework 1, an
assignment reinforcing ideas in the **building blocks** topic for P8105.

## Problem 0.1

This “problem” focuses on the use of R Markdown to write reproducible
reports, GitHub for version control, and R Projects to organize the
work.

To that end:

-   I created a public GitHub repo + local R Project; naming this repo /
    directory p8105\_hw1\_jys2137
-   I created a single .Rmd file named p8105\_hw1\_jys2137.Rmd that
    renders to github\_document
-   I submitted a link to my repo via Courseworks

## Problem 0.2

This “problem” focuses on correct styling for solutions to Problems 1
and 2.

To that end, I will make sure to:

-   use meaningful variable / object names
-   use readable code (one command per line; adequate whitespace and
    indentation; etc)
-   use clearly-written text to explain code and results
-   avoid using superfluous code (no unused variables are defined; no
    extra library calls; etc)
