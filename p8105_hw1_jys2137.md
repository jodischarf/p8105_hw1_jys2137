The purpose of this file is to present the answers to Homework 1, an
assignment reinforcing ideas in the **building blocks** topic for P8105.

## Problem 0.1

This “problem” focuses on the use of R Markdown to write reproducible
reports, GitHub for version control, and R Projects to organize the
work.

To that end:

-   I created a public GitHub repo + local R Project; naming this repo /
    directory p8105\_hw1\_jys2137
-   I created a single .Rmd file named p8105\_hw1\_jys2137.Rmd that
    renders to github\_document
-   I submitted a link to my repo via Courseworks

## Problem 0.2

This “problem” focuses on correct styling for solutions to Problems 1
and 2.

To that end, I made sure to:

-   use meaningful variable / object names
-   use readable code (one command per line; adequate whitespace and
    indentation; etc)
-   use clearly-written text to explain code and results
-   avoid using superfluous code (no unused variables are defined; no
    extra library calls; etc)

## Problem 1

### Creating the data frame

The code chunk below creates a **dataframe** comprised of:

-   a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
-   a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
    greater than 0
-   a character vector of length 10
-   a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
problem1_df = 
  tibble(
    samp = rnorm(10),
    samp_pos = samp > 0,
    vec_char = c("monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday", "saturday", "sunday", "someday", "birthday", "yesterday"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("sunny", "sunny", "sunny", "cloudy", "cloudy", "cloudy", "rainy", "rainy", "rainy", "rainy"))
)
```

### Taking the mean of each variable in the data frame

Here, we try to take the means of the variables `samp`, `samp_pos`,
`vec_char`, and `vec_factor`.

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.2611959

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, samp_pos))
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem1_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Note that when trying to take the mean, the following **works**:

-   The variable `samp`. *This is numeric.*
-   The variable `samp_pos`. *This is logical.*

When trying to take the mean, the following **does not work**:

-   The variable `vec_char`. *This is neither numeric nor logical. We
    get a warning message and a subsequent output of `NA`.*
-   The variable `vec_factor`. *As above, this is neither numeric nor
    logical. We get message and a warning and a subsequent output of
    `NA`.*

### Explicitly converting variables to numeric

The chunk below applies the `as.numeric` function to the logical,
character, and factor variables.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, samp))
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, samp_pos))
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, vec_char))
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor))
```

-   Note: the code for `samp` works because it is numeric.
-   Converting `samp_pos` to numeric **works**. This happens because it
    considered “FALSE” as 0 and “TRUE” as 1, which helps explain why it
    works when we try to take the mean since it can be calculated as a
    fraction of the values that are “TRUE”.
-   Converting `vec_char` to numeric **does not work**. We get an output
    of NAs because the values cannot be interpreted as numeric, which
    helps exlain why we could not take the mean.
-   Converting `vec_factor` to numeric **works**. This happens because
    it considered `"sunny"` as 3, `"cloudy"` as 1, and `"rainy"` as 2,
    which explains why we were able to take the mean.

## Problem 2

### Using the `penguins` dataset

The following code loads the `penguins` data set.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```
